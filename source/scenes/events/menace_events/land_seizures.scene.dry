= Land Seizures

Peasants have been energized by the revolution. Heeding the longstanding Socialist-Revolutionary calls for land redistribution, peasants have been seizing the lands of nobles and rich landowners. [? if land_reform = 0 : These are lawless acts, and there have been reports of violence - peasant mobs burning the estates of nobles. ?][? if land_reform <= 2: Despite our land reform policies, the peasants do not feel that we are moving fast enough. Peasants demand more land, more quickly. ?][? if rural_militia_strength = 0 : This is exacerbated by the lack of rural law enforcement - the old tsarist gendarmes have been largely disbanded. ?]

What should we do?

In response to the unauthorized seizures, we have formed land committees to regulate the process of redistribution and expropriation, in some cases compensating former landowners for the seized land.

In response to the illegal seizures, we have begun redistributing land to the peasant communes, to be repartitioned among the households based on how much they can work. This alleviates the peasants' land hunger somewhat.

In response to the illegal seizures, we have compensated landowners for their land, and purchased more land to be redistributed later.

[? if player_party = "sr": Our rural organizations are supporting the peasants in their struggle. This raises the status of the SRs among the peasants. ?]
[? if player_party = "b": Our support for the peasants raises our status in the villages, perhaps finally giving the Bolsheviks a foothold in the countryside. ?]

[? if sr_in_gov and land_reform_progress = 0 and player_party != "sr" : The SRs in the Provisional Government have initiated a land reform program, forming land committees to allocate acquired land. ?]

We have publicly criticized the peasants for their actions. What more can we do?

[? if player_party = "sr": Many of our supporters view us as somewhat hypocritical given our program's previous calls for uncompensated land redistribution. ?]

[? if sr_in_gov and land_reform_progress = 0 and player_party != "sr" : The SRs in the Provisional Government have initiated a land reform program, forming land committees to allocate acquired land. ?]

We have called the newfound rural militia to restore order to the countryside, stopping the land seizures. Violence continues in the countryside.

There is nothing we can do. For now, the peasants' fate is out of our hands.
