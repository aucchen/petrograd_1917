= Crime Wave

In the wake of the revolution, a crime wave has erupted throughout Russia, and Petrograd in particular. The newspapers tell lurid stories of thefts caused by desperation and hunger, of released prisoners returning to their criminal craft, of deserting soldiers resorting to banditry. In response, many citizens have turned to vigilantism, enacting mob justice on accused thieves. The economic deprivation and rapid changes in government have combined to create an atmosphere of chaos.

What can we do?

on-arrival: crime -= city_militia_strength/4*city_militia_militancy; prov_gov_legitimacy += 5 if crime < 30

We have deployed our city militia to fight crime. A replacement for the tsarist police, the militias are comprised mostly of enthusiastic but ill-trained and equiped student volunteers. [? if crime > 5: We should improve their quality if they are to successfully combat crime. ?]

[? if crime < 30 : Crime rates have been successfully reduced to an extent. ?]

on-arrival: crime -= workers_militia_strength/4*workers_militia_militancy; prov_gov_legitimacy += 5 if crime < 30

We have deployed the workers' militia to fight crime. In the working-class neighborhoods, they have already been successful in deterring criminal activity. [? if crime > 5 : Now, we will see if they can be effective in other parts of the city. ?]

[? if crime < 30 : Crime rates have been successfully reduced to an extent. ?]

[? if inflation <= 50: Our inflation rates, while still high, are no longer at their peak. ?][? if hunger < 20: Rates of hunger have been lowered, which should lower the rates of economic crime. ?][? if inflation > 50 and hunger > 20 : Unfortunately, the economic suffering continues, and so will the crime wave. ?]

[? if crime < 30 : Crime rates have been successfully reduced to an extent. ?]

There is nothing we can do. The crime wave continues to run rampant.
