# negotiate for a general peace with all powers
# negotiate separate ceasefire with central powers
# negotiate for continued financial support from the entente
# improve relations with the entente

# begin timers - war or peace: either peace treaty or war begins anew.

We have signed an armistice with the Central Powers! It is only a temprary measure; we still must negotiate a permanent peace treaty. If we do not negotiate a peace treaty in time, the Germans might resume their attack.

Our relations with the West might be irreparable after this.

We are continuing with the negotiations for a permanent peace.

[? if war_progress >= -2 and war_progress <= 0 : The war has had a mix of outcomes so far, with advances along some fronts and retreats along others, but with more defeats than victories for Russia. We will have to make territorial concessions for a peace. ?]
[? if war_progress < -2 and war_progress > -5 : Given our defeats in the war, we will likely have to make major territorial concessions in the peace. ?]
[? if war_progress <= -5 : Given our severe defeats in the war, there will be major territorial concessions in any peace treaty.  ?]
[? if war_progress > 0 : On the whole, we have an advantageous position in the negotiations, given our victories in the war. ?]

The treaty involves a loss of territory to the Central Powers, but no indemnities. Finland will become an independent state.

We have officially signed a separate peace with the Central Powers! The treaty is viewed negatively by the Kadets and those who sympathize most with the Allies, but it is generally accepted.

@treaty_harsh
on-arrival: peace_terms = -2;

= A harsh treaty

The treaty involves a loss of territory to the Central Powers. In addition, there will be some indemnity payments. Finland will become an independent state.
[? if northern_progress < 0 : The Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia will become independent, likely under the German sphere of influence. ?]
[? if western_progress < 0: Poland will be an independent state, and will be part of the German sphere of influence. We will also lose some adjacent territory inhabited mostly by Belarussians and Ukrainians. ?]

[? if southwestern_progress > 0 : We will give up our gains in the Galician (Southwestern) Front. ?]
[? if southwestern_progress <= 0 : We will give up some territory in western Ukraine. ?]

[? if caucasus_progress > 0 : We will give up our gains in the Caucasus region. ?]
[? if caucasus_progress <= 0 : We will lose some territory to the Ottoman Empire in the Caucasus region. ?]

Many Russians view the treaty as humiliating, but some see it as necessary to achieve a peace. A significant amount of our industrial production, agricultural resources, and population will be given to Germany.

We have officially signed a separate peace with the Central Powers! The treaty is viewed as harsh and humiliating in many parts of Russia, and the popularity of all of the government parties has declined.



@treaty_severe
on-arrival: peace_terms = -3; prov_gov_legitimacy -= 5;

= A severe treaty

The mere proposal of the treaty is severe enough to cause a backlash in public opinion. The treaty involves a great deal of loss of territory to the Central Powers, as well as indemnity payments of food and resources.

Finland will become an independent state.
[? if northern_progress < 0 : The Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia will become independent under the German sphere of influence, likely to become German puppet states. ?]
[? if western_progress < 0: Poland will be an independent state, and will be part of the German sphere of influence. We will also lose some adjacent territory inhabited mostly by Belarussians and Ukrainians, to be controlled by German puppet states. ?]

[? if southwestern_progress > 0 : We will give up our gains in the Galician (Southwestern) Front. ?]
[? if southwestern_progress <= 0 : Most of Ukrainian territory will become nominally independent under German influence. ?]

[? if caucasus_progress > 0 : We will give up our gains in the Caucasus region. ?]
[? if caucasus_progress <= 0 : We will lose some territory to the Ottoman Empire in the Caucasus region. ?]

Signing this treaty will likely lead to rebellion, not just among the right. A huge proportion of our industrial production, food production, and population will be given to Germany.
